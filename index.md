## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    This lab was my favorite because it was the first lab we ever worked on, giving us a better understanding of what to expect and how to enhance our coding skills. We learned how to make a repository, as well as use VS code and terminal to print out "Hello World!" Not just that but we also got the process of adding, committing, and pushing the code to the repository into github we made, making it a huge step towards our understanding of C++. 


* Lab 4, part 1

    This was my second favorite lab as we learned how to calculate something in code. In the main file code, units.cc, we had to create an algorithm in which we will input a number as milliliters, and the output would show us the calculations from milliliters to either teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. In the functions file is where we had to calculate the volume of milliliters into each other measurement as shown before. Overall, this was a very enjoyable lab.


* Lab 11, part 1

    This lab was one of the more challenging labs, however it still is one of my favorites. To begin, this lab was an object-oriented class in C++, something that we were very unfamiliar with. The function file in which we coded within asked for a for loop to act as a counter and iterator to read through the rows of the CSV table, as well as to implement functions and complete constructors for an output of the desert and sparsest states.
